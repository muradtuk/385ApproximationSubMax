We kindly refer you to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13994):
* This work introduces a novel combinatorial algorithm for maximizing a non-negative submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint.
* Our suggested method combines a practical query complexity of $O(n + k^2)$ with an approximation guarantee of $0.385$, which improves over the $\frac{1}{e}$-approximation of the state-of-the-art practical algorithm.

In this repository, we present our submodular maximization optimization code (tested with Python 3.11).
